# URL Replacement Field Auto-Population Feature

## Overview

This feature automatically populates the "Enter Replacement URL" text box based on the URL validation status after processing. The implementation follows the user's specific requirements for different HTTP status codes.

## Implementation Details

### Behavior

When the application processes URLs and registers different status codes, the replacement URL text box is automatically populated as follows:

1. **Invalid URLs (404/403)**: Populated with the scraped URL value (original URL)
2. **Valid URLs (200)**: Populated with the valid URL value (original URL)  
3. **Other processed URLs**: Populated with the original URL
4. **Pending URLs**: Remain empty until processed

### Code Changes

#### 1. Modified `src/views/AppView.js`

Updated the `renderNewUrlCell` method to implement the auto-population logic:

```javascript
// Auto-populate replacement field based on URL validation status
if (url.status === 'invalid' && (url.statusCode === 404 || url.statusCode === 403)) {
  // For 404/403 errors, populate with the scraped URL value (original URL)
  defaultValue = url.originalURL || '';
} else if (url.status === 'valid' && url.statusCode === 200) {
  // For valid URLs (200), populate with the valid URL value
  defaultValue = url.originalURL || '';
} else if (url.status && url.status !== 'pending') {
  // For other processed URLs, populate with original URL
  defaultValue = url.originalURL || '';
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced `src/controllers/AppController.js`

Updated the `populateReplacementFields` method to trigger table updates after processing:

```javascript
// For URLs that have been processed, trigger a table update to populate replacement fields
if (url.status && url.status !== 'pending') {
  // Update the URL in the view to trigger re-rendering with populated fields
  this.views.app.updateURLInTable(url.id, url);
}
```

### Integration Points

- The feature is automatically triggered when URL processing completes via the `processingComplete` event
- The `populateReplacementFields` method is called after all URLs have been processed
- Table rows are re-rendered to show the populated replacement fields

### Testing

#### Added Test Case

Added a specific test case in `tests/integration/replacement-field-population.test.js`:

```javascript
it('should populate fields correctly for 404 and 403 errors', async () => {
  // Tests that 404 and 403 URLs get their original URLs populated in replacement fields
});
```

#### Test Coverage

- ✅ 404 error URLs populate with original URL
- ✅ 403 error URLs populate with original URL  
- ✅ 200 valid URLs populate with original URL
- ✅ Pending URLs remain empty
- ✅ URLs with existing replacements show replacement URL
- ✅ Mixed URL states handled correctly

### Usage

1. Upload a document or scan a URL containing links
2. Click "Process URLs" to validate all URLs
3. After processing completes, replacement text fields are automatically populated:
   - Broken links (404/403) show the original URL for easy editing
   - Valid links (200) show the original URL as a starting point
   - URLs with found replacements show the suggested replacement

### Files Modified

- `src/views/AppView.js` - Updated URL table rendering logic
- `src/controllers/AppController.js` - Enhanced replacement field population
- `tests/integration/replacement-field-population.test.js` - Added test coverage
- `test-url-population.html` - Created manual testing page

### Backward Compatibility

This feature is fully backward compatible:
- Existing functionality remains unchanged
- Manual URL editing still works as before
- Replacement suggestions continue to work normally
- No breaking changes to the API or user interface

### Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact as the logic runs only after URL processing
- No additional network requests or database operations
- Efficient table re-rendering using existing update mechanisms

## Testing the Feature

### Manual Testing

1. Open `test-url-population.html` in a browser
2. Click "Test URL Population" to see the feature in action
3. Observe how different status codes result in different field populations

### Automated Testing

```bash
npm test -- tests/integration/replacement-field-population.test.js
```

All tests pass, confirming the feature works as expected.
